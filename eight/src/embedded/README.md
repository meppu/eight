Allows you to use eight embedded database. This feature is enabled by default.

## Why another feature?

This crate provides an official client implementation. Some people may only use client and not embedded database. So we decided to split these into features instead of crates to provide more stable updates.

## Example

Visit crate README for embedded usage example.
